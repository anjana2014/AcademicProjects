|  Important Points to Remember  |
----------------------------------

1. DO NOT CHANGE the directory structure.
2. The run_code.sh file contains the commands to execute your python code.
3. Make this file executable on your respective OS and then run it. It will execute all the python files.
4. Before submission you must run the run_code.sh file and make sure it is working and you are able to execute all your code files. The GTAs will run this file to verify your code runs.

5. Please heavily comment your code so that it is easy for the GTAs to understand and grade it.


Command to run the script are below:

Mac/Linux:
./run_code.sh

Windows:
bash ./run_code.sh

We have provided a png file which contains the decision tree output of Q1 with depth = 5.
This has been created from sklearn library.

X[0] means height
X[1] means weight
X[2] means age

This is provided to help you to see if you are headed in the right direction.
It is not required that your decision tree implementation gives the same result.
Try your best to implement it with your understanding. As long as the approach is correct, you will get the points.
Comment heavily so that grading your code is easy for the GTAs.
Comment where are you calculating the entropy
Comment where are you calculating the information gain
Comment where are you checking the splits
Comment where are you finding the thresholds

We have also provided dummy_sample_output.txt to give an idea on what to display as output.
